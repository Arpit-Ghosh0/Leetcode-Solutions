Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

P.S - Without converting it into a string. Otherwise we can just say x[::-1] and compare it with x to check.

Code:

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x<0:
            return False
        initial = x
        reverse = 0
        while x>0:
            last = x%10
            reverse = reverse * 10 + last
            x=x//10
        return initial == reverse
